# Molten salt fast reactor (MSFR) core-cavity model -- EVOL-benchmark-inspired geometry: a single,
# fully coupled, publication-quality example integrating
#
#   * fluid flow            -- incompressible Navier-Stokes (linear FV, Rhie-Chow, segregated SIMPLE),
#   * nuclear power          -- a separable cosine neutron-flux shape (simplified power production),
#   * energy deposition      -- volumetric fission heat, advected enthalpy, molecular + turbulent
#                               conduction,
#   * turbulence             -- standard k-epsilon with wall functions (turbulent viscosity mu_t),
#   * radiolysis             -- the chloride radical chain producing the oxidant Cl2.- proportional to
#                               power, transported by advection and molecular + turbulent diffusion,
#   * corrosion              -- the structural-alloy cavity walls dissolve through a temperature-
#                               dependent Butler-Volmer reaction, releasing chromium into the salt as
#                               Cr(II); the radiolytic oxidant then oxidizes it Cr(II) -> Cr(III),
#                               coupling corrosion and radiolysis through the dissolved-chromium redox.
#
# Geometry (the realistic MSFR concept rather than a channel): an open 2D core cavity bounded by solid
# structural-alloy walls. The fuel salt (NaCl-UCl3) is pumped in through a central inlet at the bottom
# and collected at a central outlet plenum at the top. The central jet rises through the core and
# entrains the surrounding salt, so two large RECIRCULATION ZONES form on either side, with the salt
# flowing back DOWN along the side walls. Those slow, recirculating regions are the realistic concern
# -- they are hotter (poor heat removal), they trap the radiolytic oxidant, and their wall corrosion
# is altered. This is the spirit of the EVOL/MSFR CFD benchmark (a heated core cavity with internal
# recirculation), here carrying the full multiphysics.
#
# Validation provenance (each physics component is validated separately in this application):
#   * turbulent flow / recirculating cavity -- validation/free_flow (ERCOFTAC channel and
#                            backward-facing-step, the canonical separated/recirculating flows),
#   * radiolysis kinetics -- validation/msr (pulse-radiolysis transient-absorption traces),
#   * corrosion kinetics  -- validation/corrosion (76 cases / 43 targets of the effective Butler-
#                            Volmer correlation; the wall rate here reproduces that calibration).
# Verification postprocessors confirm the energy balance closes (nuclear heat == enthalpy rise), the
# flow is fully turbulent (reported Reynolds number), and the recirculation is captured (reverse flow).
#
# Run:  open_pronghorn-opt -i msfr_cavity.i
# View: the Exodus output (vel with the corner recirculation, T_fluid hot spots, mu_t, Cl2m_rad,
#       Cr_II/Cr_III, corrosion_rate_um_y).
